## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yodjii/WifiMonitoring.git
cd WifiMonitoring
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Variable Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (use `.env.example` if available):
```env
SCAN_INTERVAL=15
NETWORK_RANGE=192.168.1.0/24
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=YOUR_CHAT_ID
SEND_TELEGRAM=True
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### 📛 Aliases (`aliases.json`)
Map custom names to detected hostnames (copy `aliases.json.example` to `aliases.json`):
```json
{
    "iphone-de-Nicolas.home": "📱 Nicolas's iPhone",
    "livebox.home": "🌐 Internet Box"
}
```

### 🔕 Exclusion (`excluded_macs.json`)
Prevent specific devices from triggering notifications (copy `excluded_macs.json.example` to `excluded_macs.json`):
```json
{
    "48:29:52:c2:32:57": "Unknown Device",
    "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF": "NAS Server"
}
```

## 🛠️ Usage

Simply run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

> [!TIP]
> On Windows, you can use the provided `run_wifi_monitor.bat` file to launch monitoring with a single double-click.

## 📝 Notes
- The script uses `ping` and `arp` commands to detect devices without requiring complex administrator privileges.
- Ensure your firewall allows ICMP (ping) requests.
